# Deploying the Skill

Suppose, we have a "Hello, World!" skill defined in `app.py`:

```python
from skill_sdk import skill, Response

@skill.intent_handler("HELLO_INTENT")
def hello() -> Response:
    return Response("Hello, World!")

app = skill.init_app()
app.include(handler=hello)
```

Deploy the skill with built-in [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) server:

`vs run app.py`

Here is a sample startup log (beginning of the log is skipped for readability):
```log
...
INFO:     Started server process [11175]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:4242 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

# Deploying with Gunicorn

[Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is the simplest way to deploy the skill in a production setting. 
Uvicorn includes a gunicorn worker class that means you can get set up with very little configuration.

Deploy the skill with Gunicorn on port 4242 using two workers:

`gunicorn -b :4242 -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app`

The sample startup log, notifying about successful startup:

```

```

## Logging 

To output the logs in JSON GrayLog-compatible form, skill SDK has implemented a log formatter in 
`skill_sdk.log.GunicornLogger` class. This formatter can be specified in `--logger-class` parameter:


`gunicorn -b :4242 -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --logger-class=skill_sdk.log.GunicornLogger app:app`


# Development Mode

Deploy the skill in _development mode_ with built-in [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) server:

`vs develop app.py`


# Kubernetes Integration


Along with Magenta skill-specific invoke and info endpoints, 
skill SDK for Python provides liveness and readiness probes for Kubernetes environment.

Their configuration is defined in skill settings:

- **settings.K8S_READINESS**: Kubernetes readiness probe endpoint. Default: "/k8s/readiness".


- **settings.K8S_LIVENESS**: Kubernetes liveness probe endpoint. Default: "/k8s/liveness".


# Prometheus Metrics


Along with Magenta skill-specific invoke and info endpoints, 
skill SDK for Python provides liveness and readiness probes for Kubernetes environment.

Their configuration is defined in skill settings:

- **settings.PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT**: Endpoint for Prometheus scraper. Default: "/prometheus".

> **Note**: Prometheus integration is optional: 
> to enable Prometheus metrics exporter, skill SDK must be installed with **all** optional components: `pip install skill-sdk[all]`
